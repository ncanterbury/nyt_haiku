New York Times Haiku Twitter Bot 

Todo:
    Need to add checked articles to used_urls_csv 
    build bot 

Current Issues:
    Need regex command for splitting concurrent sentences of form "sentence sentence." this is second sentence
    situation where ." precedes next sentence, currently only splitting on periods

Possible improvements:
    Should probably look at speed at some point.
    can check prev and next sentence for possible haikus that involve multiple sentences, though not top priority
